## Setup

Today's workshop is a little special. It's the first _**full stack**_ workshop you'll deal with. What this means is there is a frontend (the website) and a backend (the server). You'll need 2 active terminals to be able to run this workshop as intended.

### The Frontend (website):
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `client` folder by using `cd client`.
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Boot React with `yarn start`.

### The Backend (server):
1. Open a **new** terminal (you can use a split terminal if you want).
2. Navigate to the `server` folder by using `cd server`.
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn install`.
4. Boot the server with `yarn start`.

After following these steps, you should have 2 terminals. One should be running React, and the other should be running the server.

> **There are absolutely no changes required in the server. There is no reason to touch the server files at all. I know some of you are curious but we will cover servers soon!**

## Documentation

You'll definitely want to read and make use of the [API_DOCS.md](server/API_DOC.md) in order to figure out how to set up your application properly and which URLs you'll need for your `fetch`es.
